BindModel is both a framework and a library feature. It uses commands and entities that are not based on trendy UI components for higher productivity. Client-to-server communication can be easily implemented through the BindModel class.


## Manage Entities

BindModel manages all data as an entity (MetaTable, MetaView) to support structured data processing, enabling consistent and efficient data management.

### Transaction Support 
MetaTable supports transactions to maintain data consistency and integrity.

### Flexible Data Manipulation 
MetaTable provides the ability to add, modify, delete, and query data to facilitate data manipulation.

### Flexible UI Configuration 
MetaView can easily work with a variety of UI elements to create a dynamic and flexible user interface.

MetaTable is an entity that manages data in a table format. It is designed with a structure that is very familiar to people who have used DotNet's DataTable.

## command-based processor

BindModel provides a command-based processor to support a consistent development pattern. This structure provides a systematic and easy-to-maintain approach to command processing and data management for applications.

###  a structural approach
Command-based processors help to clearly structure an application's business logic. Each command is managed independently and can be easily modified or expanded as needed.
### Reusable
Similar tasks can be handled in multiple locations by reusing commands, which reduce redundant code writing and maintain code consistency.


## Simplicity and Productivity

BindModel increases the intuitive nature of code by minimizing specific grammar or indicators and eliminating unnecessary components. OOP-based design minimizes code duplication by utilizing inheritance and provides simplicity and high productivity to users by designing based on frequency of use in projects.

### Minimize code duplication
It provides an efficient structure to avoid the need for repeated code writing, increasing maintenance and scalability.

### User-friendly
It is designed to make it easy for beginners to learn, and users with experience in web development can create a website with two to three hours of learning.

### Low design burden
There is less pressure on file and screen component division, so you don't have to spend a lot of time designing the project's initial design.

### efficient development
With BindModel, you can significantly reduce the number of files, code lines, code complexity, and development time, so you can experience more than five times more productivity.


## Independent View

BindModel serves as a controller of the MVC pattern and is completely separate from View, making it very easy to replace and manage the screen. This design allows developers to manage the logic of applications with minimal impact on UI changes.


## Inject service objects

By supporting service object injection, BindModel can maximize the flexibility of the framework and increase the reuse of objects. Through service object injection, common functions of applications can be modularized and dependency management can be simplified.


## object serialization

BindModel supports object serialization, allowing for efficient transfer and remote control of objects. Object serialization plays an important role in storing the state of an object or in communicating with other systems.


## backward compatibility

BindModel is built in JavaScript ECMAScript 5 (ES5) grammar to ensure backward compatibility. It works reliably in a variety of environments and ensures compatibility with existing JavaScript code.


## TypeScript support

BindModel provides TypeScript type information in development environments, helping developers write codes more safely and efficiently. TypeScript's static type checks prevent code errors and greatly improve development productivity through code completion.


## Promise Support

BindModel provides Promise per command, helping you to process asynchronous tasks more easily. Promise provides the methods needed to process the results of asynchronous tasks (then, catch, finally), greatly improving the readability and maintenance of code.


## Integrated Library

It is a harmonious collection of libraries needed for web development, such as routing, form management, and client-server communication.
